Hello! Thank you for taking interest in the development of the PortalBot.

-> TO RUN <-
1. You must "ffmpeg.exe" installed to the same location that the "bot.py" file is found.
2. In "secret.py" you must replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN with your own bot token (return: string)
3. The filepaths are linked to my own personal host computer, these will need to be changed depending on your system.
4. Run the "main.py" file in either cmd or your vscode console to initiate the bot.
